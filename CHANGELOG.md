# Changelog

## 0.4.0

### New

* An environment variable `OMERO_PASSWORD` can (and should!) now be used to supply the
  sensitive part of the user credentials that are necessary to connect to OMERO. This
  avoids having the password as plain-text in the system's process list (e.g. when
  calling `ps fu -e` or similar) and also prevents it from showing up in an annotated
  stack trace in case an uncaught exception is raised.
* Log level of the HRM-OMERO connector itself can now be set through the configuration
  option `OMERO_CONNECTOR_LOGLEVEL` in the HRM config file.
* Debug logging for the OMERO *import call* can now be requested be setting the
  configuration option `OMERO_DEBUG_LOG` in the HRM config file.
* `hrm_omero.hrm.parse_summary()` has been added to provide a function for parsing the
  parameter summary from an HRM job into a (nested) dict.
* `hrm_omero.hrm.parse_job_basename()` has been added to identify the base name of all
  files that belong to the set of results from a certain HRM job.
* `hrm_omero.omero.add_annotation_keyvalue()` can be used to add so-called [Map
  Annotations][c4] (key-value pairs) to objects in OMERO.
* A decorator `hrm_omero.decorators.connect_and_set_group()` is now available that can
  be used with functions that require a valid connection plus an OMERO object identifier
  pair (submitted on the command line as "`G:4:Image:12345`" or similar, passed on to
  the decorated function as `obj_type` and `obj_id`).
* `hrm_omero.misc.printlog()` can be used to push a message to the log and stdout.
* A class `hrm_omero.misc.OmeroId` provides parsing, validation and access to all
  group-qualified OMERO object IDs (commonly passed as function parameter `id_str`
  throughout the existing code).
* The CLI has a new optional parameter `--dry-run` that prevents any action from being
  performed, instead the name of the function and the corresponding parameters that
  would be called are printed to stdout.
* Unit tests using [pytest][c2] and [pytest-cov][c3] (incomplete).

### Changes

* Uploading images to OMERO into another group than the user's default one is now
  properly supported.
* HRM job parameter summaries are now being added as OMERO ["Map Annotations"][c4]
  instead of simply being a comment string.
* *Datasets* in OMERO that are not associated to a *Project* will no longer be ignored
  but rather be shown on the same level than the user's projects, just as OMERO.web and
  OMERO.insight are doing it.
* The command line parameter `--password` (or `-w`) is now *deprecated* in favor of
  using the environment variable described above.
* The following functions are now *deprecated* and will be removed in a future release.
  * `hrm_omero.omero.connect()`
  * `hrm_omero.cli.parse_arguments()`
* Functions `hrm_omero.transfer.to_omero()` and `hrm_omero.transfer.from_omero()` are
  now raising a `ValueError` in case the provided `id_str` is malformed.
* Various improvements on log messages.
* Unit string literal `Âµm` is no longer converted to `um` in parameter summaries.
* New dependencies: [Pillow][c1]

### Fixes

* Thumbnail download has been adapted to recent code changes in OMERO.
