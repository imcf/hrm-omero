# Changelog

## 0.4.0

### New

* An environment variable `OMERO_PASSWORD` can (and should!) now be used to supply the
  sensitive part of the user credentials that are necessary to connect to OMERO. This
  avoids having the password as plain-text in the system's process list (e.g. when
  calling `ps fu -e` or similar) and also prevents it from showing up in an annotated
  stack trace in case an uncaught exception is raised.
* Log level of the HRM-OMERO connector itself can now be set through the configuration
  option `OMERO_CONNECTOR_LOGLEVEL` in the HRM config file.
* Debug logging for the OMERO *import call* can now be requested be setting the
  configuration option `OMERO_DEBUG_LOG` in the HRM config file.
* `hrm_omero.hrm.parse_summary()` has been added to provide a function for parsing the
  parameter summary from an HRM job into a (nested) dict.
* `hrm_omero.hrm.parse_job_basename()` has been added to identify the base name of all
  files that belong to the set of results from a certain HRM job.
* `hrm_omero.omero.add_annotation_keyvalue()` can be used to add so-called [Map
  Annotations][c4] (key-value pairs) to objects in OMERO.
* Unit tests using [pytest][c2] and [pytest-cov][c3] (incomplete).

### Changes

* Uploading images to OMERO into another group than the user's default one is now
  properly supported.
* HRM job parameter summaries are now being added as OMERO ["Map Annotations"][c4]
  instead of simply being a comment string.
* The function `hrm_omero.omero.connect()` is now deprecated and will be removed in a
  subsequent release.
* Functions `hrm_omero.transfer.to_omero()` and `hrm_omero.transfer.from_omero()` are
  now raising a `ValueError` in case the provided `id_str` is malformed.
* Various improvements on log messages.
* Unit string literal `Âµm` is no longer converted to `um` in parameter summaries.
* New dependencies: [Pillow][c1]

### Fixes

* Thumbnail download has been adapted to recent code changes in OMERO.
