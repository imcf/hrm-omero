# The HRM-OMERO connector

This project provides a connector to allow for communication between an [HRM (Huygens
Remote Manager)][1] and an [OMERO server][2].

Its purpose is to simplify the data transfer by allowing raw images to be downloaded
from OMERO as well as uploading deconvolution results back to OMERO directly from within
the HRM web interface.
